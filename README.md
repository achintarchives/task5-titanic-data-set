Summary

EDA of the Titanic dataset shows that gender, age, passenger class, and fare were the main factors influencing survival. Younger passengers, females, and those in higher classes with higher fares had higher survival rates. Other features like family size had minimal impact.

Chart Observations

Age Distribution (Histogram) – Majority of passengers were 20–30 years old.

Fare Distribution (Histogram) – Most fares were low; a few high-fare outliers exist.

Passenger Gender Count (Countplot) – More males than females overall.

Passenger Class Count (Countplot) – Most passengers were 3rd class.

Age vs Survival (Boxplot) – Younger passengers had better survival chances.

Survival by Gender (Countplot) – Females survived at a much higher rate than males.

Survival by Passenger Class (Countplot) – 1st class survived the most; 3rd class the least.

Fare vs Survival (Boxplot) – Higher fare passengers had higher survival.

Age vs Fare by Survival (Scatterplot) – Younger passengers paying higher fares had highest survival; older, low-fare passengers mostly did not survive.

Correlation Matrix (Heatmap) – Pclass negatively correlates with survival; Fare positively correlates; other numeric features have weak correlations.
